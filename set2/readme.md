Week 2: While having picked up some of the keywords and learning the base knowledge on how to code during the lecture, I still make some obvious mistakes in the exercises and at times I would forget the fundamental ways on how to utilise different types of methods to get the wanted outcome. I've realized that before I entered anything, I first have to identify what is the most suitable way to approach each part of the exercise. Furthermore, I realized that I am too rigid in my way of thinking and that I should allow myself to experiment rather than striving to get the correct answer before testing the code. This let me to understand that there is a lot of freedom to test out an initial hypothesis and add slight changes to each part of the code and see its effect. Through mistakes and the exercises done, I've gradually gotten use to the format and keywords used and ways to tweak my code so that I could get the right answer.
