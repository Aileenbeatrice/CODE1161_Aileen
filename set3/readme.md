This week, I was able to learn how to use the while loop and the try-catch block to execute the instructed outcomes asked in set 3. I still make mistakes in formatting or missing some punctuations here and there but as I start to get used to reading and typing in python, I was able to identify my mistake easier. Learning the while loop and the try-catch block was a bit of confusing at first, as the other weeks' exercises are too. This time, I was confused on how to add inputs and the way to format everything because I wasn't taking my time to research and digest the information I found in the lectures and online. However, I slowly understood the functions of the parts of the loops and which part to return/break. Furthermore, I came across a problem where the code kept on repeatingly input the given prompt into my terminal, which halted me from testing the other parts of the exercise. Thus, I learned that I could use ctrl + C to stop the code from running and retest my work.
